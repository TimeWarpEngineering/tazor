# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural and design documentation for the Tazor compiler (fork of dotnet/razor).

## Documents

### [razor-compiler-outputs.md](razor-compiler-outputs.md)
Comprehensive documentation of all outputs generated by the Razor compiler, including:
- Generated file types and their purposes
- Complete 10-phase compilation pipeline
- Intermediate representation (IR) with 70+ node types
- Output characteristics and locations
- Integration points with MSBuild and source generators
- Transition considerations for moving to `.tazor` extension

**Use Case**: Understanding what the compiler generates and how the generation pipeline works. Essential reference for making architectural changes.

### [nuget-packages-analysis.md](nuget-packages-analysis.md)
Analysis of all 21 NuGet packages built by this repository, including:
- 15 shipping packages (Compiler, Toolset, IDE extensions, language servers)
- 6 non-shipping packages (internal transport and test)
- Package purposes and consumers
- Dependency graph
- Distribution channels
- Implications for Tazor transition

**Use Case**: Understanding the package ecosystem, what each package does, and which packages need to be forked/renamed for Tazor.

## Purpose

These documents serve as:
1. **Baseline Reference**: Understanding the current Razor implementation
2. **Transition Planning**: Identifying what needs to change for Tazor
3. **Architectural Knowledge**: Preserving deep understanding of the system

## Tazor Vision

**Current State**: Razor compiler for `.tazor` files generating Blazor components

**Target State**:
- File extension: `.tazor` → `.tazor`
- Output: Blazor components → TUI (Terminal UI) components
- SDK: Integrated with Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor → Independent Tazor SDK
- Target frameworks: net472, netstandard2.0, net8.0, net9.0 → net10.0+ only

**Approach**: Small, verifiable increments starting with file extension change
